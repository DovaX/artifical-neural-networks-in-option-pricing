# artifical-neural-networks-in-option-pricing

Master thesis at the Institute of Economic Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague

The thesis aimed to and sucessfully achieved better performance in option pricing using neural networks models in comparison to the classical parametric Black-Scholes formula comparing several methods. New approaches were tested such as adding of virtual options and comparing modular neural network architecture with the fully connected feedforward neural network. A general pattern was introduced which suggested how to choose the parameters for the neural networks specifically in option pricing applications. The thesis evaluated performance of various sizes and number of hidden layers on the overall pricing performance.
