# artifical-neural-networks-in-option-pricing

Master thesis at the Institute of Economic Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague

The thesis tried to achieve better performance in option pricing using neural networks models in comparison to the classical parametric Black-Scholes formula. Several new approaches were tested such as adding of virtual options and comparing modular neural network architecture with the fully connected feedforward neural network. A general pattern was introduced which suggests how to choose the parameters for the neural networks specifically in option pricing applications.
